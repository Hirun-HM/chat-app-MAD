# 🧪 Chat App Testing Guide

## ✅ Problems Fixed

### 1. **Messages Persistence Issue** - SOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Messages disappeared when app was closed and reopened
- **Solution**: Added chat history functionality that loads previous messages from SQLite database
- **Implementation**: 
  - Server now has `get_chat_history` event handler
  - Flutter app requests chat history on connection
  - Messages are loaded from database and displayed

### 2. **Real-time Messaging Testing** - SOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Needed a way to test real-time messaging between multiple users
- **Solution**: Created automated testing script that simulates two users
- **Implementation**: 
  - `test-chat.js` simulates two users (John Doe and Jane Smith)
  - Both users connect, exchange messages in real-time
  - Messages are saved to database automatically

## 🚀 How to Test Everything

### **Step 1: Start the Server**
```bash
cd /Users/hirunmihisarakariyawasam/Documents/projects/ChatApp-main
npm start
```

### **Step 2: Test Real-time Messaging (Automated)**
```bash
# In a new terminal
npm run test-chat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🧪 Testing Real-time Chat Between Two Users
👤 User 1 (John Doe) connected
👤 User 2 (Jane Smith) connected
📜 User 2 received chat history: X messages
💬 User 1 sending message to User 2...
📨 User 2 received: Hello Jane! This is a test message from John.
💬 User 2 replying to User 1...
📨 User 1 received: Hi John! I received your message. This is Jane replying.
✅ Test completed!
```

### **Step 3: Verify Message Persistence**
```bash
npm run inspect-db
```

You should see all messages stored in the MESSAGES table with:
- `chat_id`: Which chat the message belongs to
- `sender_id`: Who sent the message
- `message_text`: The actual message content
- `sent_at`: Timestamp when message was sent

### **Step 4: Test with Flutter App**

1. **Start your Flutter app**:
   ```bash
   cd chatapp
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Updated Flutter Code Features**:
   - ✅ Automatically requests chat history on connection
   - ✅ Displays previous messages when app reopens
   - ✅ Real-time messages still work
   - ✅ Messages persist in SQLite database

## 📱 Flutter App Updates Made

### **Individual Page Changes**:
```dart
// Added chat history request
socket.emit("get_chat_history", {
  "sourceId": widget.sourceChat?.id,
  "targetId": widget.chatModel?.id,
});

// Added chat history handler
socket.on("chat_history", (data) => {
  // Loads previous messages from database
  // Displays them in the correct order
});
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Verification

Your SQLite database now properly stores:

### **Messages Table**:
- `id` - Unique message ID
- `chat_id` - Links to specific chat
- `sender_id` - User who sent the message  
- `message_text` - The actual message content
- `message_type` - text/image/video/audio/file
- `file_path` - For media messages
- `sent_at` - Timestamp
- `delivered_at` - When delivered (for future use)
- `read_at` - When read (for future use)

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Message Persistence**
1. Send messages using Flutter app
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. **Result**: Previous messages should still be visible ✅

### **Scenario 2: Real-time Messaging**
1. Run `npm run test-chat`
2. Watch messages being exchanged in real-time
3. Check database with `npm run inspect-db`
4. **Result**: Messages appear instantly and are saved to database ✅

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Users (Manual)**
1. Install app on two different devices/emulators
2. Use different user IDs (1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. Send messages between them
4. **Result**: Messages appear on both devices in real-time ✅

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
npm start        # Start the server
npm run dev      # Start server with auto-restart
npm run test-chat    # Test real-time messaging between 2 users
npm run inspect-db   # View database contents
```

## 📊 Server Console Output

When testing, you'll see:
```
👤 User 1 signed in with socket abc123
📱 User 1 joined chat room: chat_1
📜 Getting chat history between 1 and 2
📤 Sending 3 messages to user 1
📨 Received message: Hello Jane!
✅ Message saved with ID: 4
```
